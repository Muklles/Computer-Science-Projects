# CS50 Projects (Introduction to Computer Science)

Projects developed as part of the CS50: Introduction to Computer Science course.

## Project List

### [Week 0: Scratch](/CS50/Scratch%20PROJETO%200.sb3)

A project introducing programming concepts using Scratch, a visual programming language.

**What I learned:**
- Developed interactive stories and animations
- Learned about event-driven programming and loops
- Applied logic and sequencing to solve problems
- Gained experience with basic user interface elements

### [Week 1: C Basics](/CS50/PROJETO%201)

Projects focused on learning C programming fundamentals through practical exercises.

**Hello:**  
A project focused on writing your first C program to print output and understand compilation.  
- Learned basic C syntax and program structure  
- Used `printf` for output  
- Compiled and ran C programs successfully  
- Understood functions and main program flow  

**Mario:**  
A project to create pyramid patterns in C, inspired by Super Mario.  
- Implemented loops (`for` and `while`) for pattern generation  
- Used conditional statements for alignment  
- Practiced step-by-step problem solving  
- Enhanced understanding of modular programming  

**Credit:**  
A project to validate credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm.  
- Implemented mathematical algorithms in C  
- Applied loops, conditionals, and functions for real-world problems  
- Learned to handle user input and validate data  
- Gained experience with algorithmic thinking and debugging
